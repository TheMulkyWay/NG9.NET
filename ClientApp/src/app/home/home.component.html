        For organisations needing more Web components delivered more quickly this a small free example showing how this might be achieved.
        <br /><br />

        This means any operations requiring, secure data gathering and sharing can be up and running in less time, and that this is achievable because the means of production is cloud based.
        <br /><br />
        As a practical example using the simple functionality here I am prepaired to demonstrate feature changes together with the build pipeline and live deployment to show how well any change management can meet your requirments.

      Spring time 2020 and the first set of pipeline components are ready.<br />

    <br />
    <p>
      This development of this domain is within a cloud based continuous integration, build and deployment pipeline*<br />

      An ASP.NET Core API backend and an Angular CLI UI running on Azure linked to a public Github <code>repo</code>.
      <br /><br />
      <br />
      * The CI-CD service is free from visualstudio.com as is this demo subdomain hosting from Azure<br />
    </p>


    <br />




    <p>Whilst <code>source control and testing</code> are vital,  gathering needs, agile development and day to day concerns like developer standards and practices,  naming, branching and migrations etc  are intially addressed with short demo video links and info.<br />
    <p>Further info  about previous public Web Apps and in-house LOB apps are being continually added</p>

  <mat-tab label="Tech Drilldown">

    ASP.NET Core 3.1 Restful Web API's using Entity Framework Core and ADO.NET with SQL Server Databases.*
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Basic examples of standard client and server unit test runner / frameworks Karma, Jasmine MsTest are included.
    </p>

    Where possible I have written some fluent test code for C# MVC controllers and EF Core as well as for client side Typescript<br />
    <br />
    Where TDD meets Code First, some considerations.
    <br />Renaming it feature driven lowers pressure.
    <br />
    Where GIT meets EF Migrations, some considerations.
